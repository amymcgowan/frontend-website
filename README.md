# Authentic Grace 1.0

The original version of the project was the front-end of the website and was built collaboratively by [Racquel Tung](https://racqcancode.github.io/portfolio-WIP) and [Amy McGowan](https://amymcgowan.dev) as a response to an assigment during Cohort 4 of [The Moms Can: Code School](https://www.momscan.co/).

More details can be viewed at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/racqcancode/frontend-website).  This [first version of the site](https://loving-minsky-8fe614.netlify.com/) was deployed on Netlify.



## Some Bits That I've Learned Through This Project
- Sometimes footers don't stick to the bottom without [a little extra help](https://medium.com/@zerox/keep-that-damn-footer-at-the-bottom-c7a921cb9551)

- [What to do](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22786357/anchor-tag-is-larger-than-element-it-holds) when an anchor tag is appearing bigger than the inside element (ie an img) 

- I found an easy way to [create a responsive navbar](https://itnext.io/how-to-build-a-responsive-navbar-using-flexbox-and-javascript-eb0af24f19bf) with flexbox and a tiny bit of JavaScript
