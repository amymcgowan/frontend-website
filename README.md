# Authentic Grace 1.0

The original version of the project was the front-end of the website and was built collaboratively by [Racquel Tung](https://racqcancode.github.io/portfolio-WIP) and [Amy McGowan](https://amymcgowan.dev) as a response to an assigment during Cohort 4 of [The Moms Can: Code School](https://www.momscan.co/).

More details can be viewed at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/racqcancode/frontend-website).  This [first version of the site](https://loving-minsky-8fe614.netlify.com/) was deployed on Netlify.
