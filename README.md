## About the Project

Authentic Grace is a fictional brick-and-mortar clothing store in need of a website to increase visibility, establish an online presence, and display products.

This version of the project is an update on the original.  I added a [product detail page](https://authenticgraceboutique.netlify.com/perfect-skinny-jeans.html) that can be accessed from the homepage by clicking the first image in the "shop from our social" section.  I also updated the site as a whole to more closely conform to web accessibility guidelines.  

## Project Guidelines

The requirements of this version of the project were...
* Create web accessibility audit report and make website more accessible
* Add a page for one of the clothing items on the website
* Create wireframe for new page

## Project Partial Screenshot of New Page

# Authentic Grace 1.0

The original version of the project was the front-end of the website and was built collaboratively by [Racquel Tung](https://racqcancode.github.io/portfolio-WIP) and [Amy McGowan](https://amymcgowan.dev) as a response to an assigment during Cohort 4 of [The Moms Can: Code School](https://www.momscan.co/).

More details can be viewed at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/racqcancode/frontend-website).  This [first version of the site](https://loving-minsky-8fe614.netlify.com/) was deployed on Netlify.



## Some Bits That I've Learned Through This Project
* Sometimes footers don't stick to the bottom without [a little extra help](https://medium.com/@zerox/keep-that-damn-footer-at-the-bottom-c7a921cb9551)
* [What to do](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22786357/anchor-tag-is-larger-than-element-it-holds) when an anchor tag is appearing bigger than the inside element (ie an img) 
* I found an easy way to [create a responsive navbar](https://itnext.io/how-to-build-a-responsive-navbar-using-flexbox-and-javascript-eb0af24f19bf) with flexbox and a tiny bit of JavaScript
* I learned how to [customize radio buttons](https://markheath.net/post/customize-radio-button-css)
* For another time: I can [customize the select dropdown](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_custom_select.asp)
* Mobile-first is really a good way to go...

## Room for Improvement
* Make website more responsive, especially the new product page
* Learn how to turn features on the homepage into real sliders/carousels
* Adjust some of the padding and font styles to better match wireframe
